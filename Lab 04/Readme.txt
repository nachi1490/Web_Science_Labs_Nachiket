Added CSS media queries and used the JQuery mobile library to make the twitter ticker from lab 1 responsive.

Some bullet points: 
1.) Added a break point in the main div which was a container for both the tweets and the hashtags
2.) According to this breakpoint, and by using CSS media queries, the page becomes reponsive whenever the browser is resized below 50 em.
3.) Also made use of JQuery mobile classes such as ui-grid and ui-block. Made use of ui-responsive class for the individual tweet and hashtags div to resize automatically according to browser size.
