1.) We have decided to go with GitHub for source version control(SVC) as it is the most popular opensource SVC available which provides Bug tracking facility as well

2.) We are going to use the Heroku Cloud application server platform to host our application. As there were a very few options available to host a Node.js server for free, we chose Heroku as our hosting platform. 

3.) Links of Git repo's (individual and group) have been collaberated with the professor and TA.
